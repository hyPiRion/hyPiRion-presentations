# Kurs i Clojure

An introduction to Clojure in Norwegian.

## Compiling

To compile, one must have pygments installed. This will most likely be available
through your favourite package manager in your standard distro repository. In
addition, you need to install the [[solarized-pygments]] style for pygments. In
theory, one should then be able to create the PDF by simply doing `make`.
